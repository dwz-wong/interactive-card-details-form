## My Process

### Built with

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this Frontend Mentor project or challenge, I learned to design a credit card form similar to the preview design provided. Additionally, I have used regex for the credit card form by coding JavaScript in this project or challenge to ensure that users have entered the input in the correct format. When the users didn't enter or have entered the input in the wrong format, it will pop up the error message.

### Continued development

I will keep challenging any challenges or projects to improve my front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
